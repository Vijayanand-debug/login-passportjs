In this project unlike all the others, we have use express.router method.
And also instead of creating all the routes on a single app.js file, 
we have used require method and required all the routes from a separate route page.
and on the route page we have used module.export method.

we have used express-sessions and flash messages and created a custom middleware 
with global variables. We have used these variables to display success and 
error messages once the user registers in. We had to do this because, unlike 
displaying errors like "fill in all the fields", "password should be atleast 6 
characters" which we rendered on the same page, we had to display successfully 
registered or not messages when the page is being redirected. Whenever you want 
to display messages during a page redirection, we have to create a express session 
and then in that session display the message using flash middleware.


We have used bcrypt for encrypting the user password before saving it on to the 
db. Then used passport in order to authenticate the user.
